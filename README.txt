rateMonotonicSimulator

This is a student extracurricular project at the Faculty of Computer Science of Megatrend University in Belgrade, Serbia.

The objective of the excercise is to create a realiable simulator for real time system algorithms such as Rate Monotonic, EDF and possibly some others in due course. 

We are using Java for this project.

This simulator will then be used to gather statistical data about behaviour of these algorithms in different circumstances, and the data will be used for comparative analysis.

For now, we have the skeleton code for the simulator, but are planning on implementing a way to produce log files usable for drawing Gant's diagrams, and extracting all the relevant data as well.

Stay tuned for updates.
